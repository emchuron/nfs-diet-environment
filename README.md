# Overview
This repository contains the code and data associated with a paper describing the relationships between northern fur seal diet composition and environmental conditions within foraging areas on the Pribilof Islands, as well as the influence of diet composition on fur seal pup mass and early mortality.

# Structure
The four folders in this repository are: 
1) **data** - the input data used in analyses and many of the figures
2) **R** - contains all the code used to compile and analzye data and results
3) **output** - contains saved output from analyses
4) **figures** - figures generated for the publication.

Diet and pup metrics in their rawest form are not provided but the code used to generate the summaries from these datasets are included ("create-UD", "create-diet", "create-pup metrics" in R folder). The data summaries are provided in the data folder, which are the basis for all of the analyses described in the paper. One of the outputs used to create a supplemental figure is not included due to size.

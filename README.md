# Overview
This repository contains the code and data associated with a paper describing the relationships between northern fur seal diet composition and environmental conditions within foraging areas on the Pribilof Islands, as well as the influence of diet composition on fur seal pup mass and early mortality. This paper, titled "Biological and physical environmental drivers of diet variation in northern fur seals", is currently submitted to Ecology and Evolution. 

# Structure
The four folders in this repository are: data (the input data used in analyses), R (contains all the code used to compile and analzye data and results), output (contains saved output from analyses), and figures (figures generated for the publication). Diet and pup metrics in their rawest form are not provided but the code used to generate the summaries from these datasets are provided ("create-UD", "create-diet", "create-pup metrics" in R folder). The data summaries are provided in the "data" folder, which are the basis for all of the analyses described in the paper.
